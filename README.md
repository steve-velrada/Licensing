This is a collection of Microsoft 365 Licensing Diagrams, updated on a roughly monthly cycle as product names, feature inclusions, and licensing changes.


You will find PDF, PNG, and Visio source files for most of the diagrams, some are more current than others so please do check the commit date and let me know if you need an updated version of any of these.

The PDF files have links on every tile so you can click through to more information!



All feedback is greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

 \- Steve.
